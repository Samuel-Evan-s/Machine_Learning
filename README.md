# Machine_Learning
A collection of my machine learning projects documenting my learning journey, covering applied machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision through hands-on implementations.

Each project is self-contained and explores a specific model, architecture, or idea—ranging from classical neural networks to convolutional models—using real datasets and standard ML tools.

## Scope
The projects in this repository cover:
- Applied machine learning fundamentals
- Deep learning with neural networks
- Computer vision models (e.g. CNNs)
- Model training, evaluation, and experimentation

The goal of this repository is learning by building, with an emphasis on clarity, correctness, and practical understanding.
